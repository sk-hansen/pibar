# Session Browser — Omarchy bar widget

A native [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) bar panel that answers: **what AI
coding sessions have I run on this machine, and how do I get back into one?**

It discovers past sessions from **Claude Code, Codex, opencode, Copilot CLI,
Pi, Gemini CLI, and Grok Build** and lists them newest-first with the opening
prompt or title, project directory, and relative age. Filter by agent with one
click, then **Enter resumes the exact session in a terminal**, opened in its
original working directory. The selected row expands with metadata (message
count, model, duration, size — plus token count and cost for opencode) and
per-session controls.

## What it runs, exactly

This plugin does more than observe, so here is the complete inventory. The
helper script is [`list-sessions`](list-sessions) — plain python3; read it
before installing, as you should for any shell plugin (Omarchy plugins run
unsandboxed).

**Scanning (on panel open or `r` — nothing polls in the background):**

- Reads session transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.codex/sessions/`,
  `~/.copilot/`, `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`, `~/.gemini/tmp/`, Grok's
  `$GROK_HOME/sessions/` (or `~/.grok/sessions/`), and opencode's sqlite
  database (opened read-only). Local reads only; **no network access, no
  telemetry, nothing written to disk**.
- Shows resumable top-level conversations, not worker sessions. It uses each
  agent's native hierarchy marker: Codex thread metadata, Claude sidechains,
  opencode's `parent_id`, Gemini's nested/kind metadata, and Grok's
  `session_kind` plus child registry. Copilot keeps child events inside the
  parent log, while Pi's built-in subagents run without persistent sessions.
  Explicit user forks remain visible.
- **Hard bounds before parsing:** each provider considers at most 128 matching
  candidates and returns at most 50 sessions. A scan has cumulative ceilings
  of 1,024 paths, 768 file opens, 64 MiB read, and four seconds. Regular files
  are opened with no-follow/nonblocking flags and verified with `fstat`; FIFOs,
  devices, sockets, and leaf symlinks are skipped. JSON files are capped at
  2 MiB, JSONL title reads at 1 MiB per file, individual lines at 256 KiB,
  metadata passes at 2 MiB, and the opencode database at 512 MiB with bounded
  result fields, row counts, SQLite VM work, and a deadline progress handler.
  The database plus WAL/SHM footprint is conservatively charged in full to the
  same 64 MiB cumulative allowance, and every auxiliary file receives the same
  regular-file check.
- The helper caps its own JSON output at 900 KiB. Independently, the panel
  terminates collection after six seconds and rejects payloads over 1 MiB
  before `JSON.parse`. If a cumulative collection ceiling prevents a complete
  scan, retained rows remain usable and the header reports partial results.
  Output trimming uses a bounded binary search rather than repeatedly walking
  every row. Titles are capped at 90 characters; all session-derived text is
  stripped of terminal control bytes and renders as plain text
  (`Text.PlainText`). Malformed, excessively nested JSON records are skipped.

**Actions (each runs only on your explicit click/keypress on that row):**

- **Resume** — launches that agent's own targeted resume command (`claude
  --resume <id>`, `codex resume <id>`, `opencode --session <id>`, `copilot
  --resume <id>`, `pi --session <path>`, `gemini --resume <id>`, or `grok
  --resume <id>`) in a new terminal via `xdg-terminal-exec`, `cd`'d to the
  session's directory.
- **Peek** — renders the transcript (control characters stripped) into a
  floating terminal with `less`, with independent three-second, 8 MiB, and
  400-block limits. Its opencode query streams at most 400 bounded rows rather
  than materializing the complete result set.
- **Folder** — opens the session's directory with `xdg-open`.
- **Copy ID** — copies the session id with `wl-copy`.
- **Delete** — permanently removes that one session (transcript files, or
  `opencode session delete`). Requires a second confirming press, and is
  offered only for agents where deletion is well-defined.
- Session ids are validated against strict per-agent patterns before any
  action runs; anything else is refused. Panel actions have an eight-second
  watchdog, and synchronous clipboard/deletion commands have their own shorter
  timeouts. **No sudo, no pkexec, no polkit.**

The screenshot above uses synthetic session names and paths; no private
transcript data is included in the repository.

## Requirements

Omarchy 4.x. Runtime commands used by the plugin—`python3`, `bash`, `less`,
`setsid`, `uwsm-app`, `xdg-open`, `xdg-terminal-exec`, and `wl-copy`—ship
with Omarchy. The Python collector uses only the standard library and never
installs packages.

The agent CLIs are optional. A provider appears when it has sessions on disk;
its CLI is needed only when you choose **Resume** for one of those sessions.
No API keys, accounts, network services, or background daemon are required by
the plugin itself.

Run the fixture suite with:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/Sudhanshugtm/omarchy-session-browser.git --enable
```

## Use

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Left-click bar icon | Open the session list |
| Click a row / `Enter` | Resume that session in a terminal |
| Arrows | Move selection (list auto-scrolls) |
| `←`/`→` or pill click | Filter by agent |
| `p` | Peek at the transcript |
| `o` | Open the session's folder |
| `y` | Copy the session id |
| `d` `d` | Delete the session (double-press to confirm) |
| `r` | Rescan |
| `Esc` | Close panel |

IPC target for keybindings: `omarchy-shell sid.sessions toggle`.

## Remove

```bash
omarchy plugin remove sid.sessions
```

Deletes the plugin folder and removes the widget from the bar. Your agents'
session stores are never touched by removal.
